AutoHotkey script -- Left Control is Escape when released; Enter when pressed is Control modifier, when released Enter

This script utilizes AutoHotkey script "dual".

When do you press Control modifier only by itself? Let's take advantage of that fact, and use Control also as Escape.
Same goes for Enter key, you never use it in combination with other keys, but you could. Making Enter to act as Control
modifier means that it is now much more reachable with pinkie then before.
